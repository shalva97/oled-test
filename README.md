# OLED Test App

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already).
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. If `open: true` is set in `vite.config.js`, it should open in your default browser automatically.

## Other Scripts

- **Build for production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

- **Preview the production build**:
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```
  This allows you to test the production build locally.
